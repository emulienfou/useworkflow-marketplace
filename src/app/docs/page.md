Learn how to discover, install, and use plugins with your AI Workflow Builder.

## What are plugins?

Plugins are reusable extensions for the **AI Workflow Builder Template**.   
They provide specific capabilities and integrations that help you build more powerful workflow automation platforms.   
Think of them as building blocks that expand what your workflows can achieve, from code generation to third-party
service connections.

## Getting started

To use these plugins, we require that you first have an instance of the platform running. You can do this in two ways:

1. **Deploy** the [AI Workflow Builder Template](https://github.com/vercel-labs/workflow-builder-template) on Vercel.
2. **Clone** the repository to your local machine.

Once your platform is set up, installing a plugin is simple:

1. Navigate to the plugin you wish to use in
   the [Marketplace Repository](https://github.com/emulienfou/useworkflow-marketplace/tree/main/plugins).
2. **Copy** the plugin source code or repository link.
3. **Paste** it into your AI Workflow Builder project configuration to make it available to your users.

## Community Driven

The WorkflowBuilder Marketplace is powered by the community.   
Unlike centralized stores with opaque rankings, our plugins are open-source and hosted directly on GitHub.   
This ensures transparency and allows developers to easily contribute their own integrations to the ecosystem.

## Browse plugins

Visit the homepage to browse the full directory of available plugins and discover new capabilities for your automation
platform.

## Security and Review

Since plugins are installed via direct code integration or repository links, we recommend reviewing the source code of
any plugin before adding it to your production environment.   
As an open-source project, security is a shared responsibility, and we encourage the community to report any potential
issues directly on the GitHub repository.
